 Java Basics
Class - Collection of variables and methods
Object - object is the instance of the class
Methods - Task that needs to be executed


Destructor ==> destructor in Java? It is a special method that automatically gets called when an object is no longer used.
When an object completes its life-cycle the garbage collector deletes that object and deallocates or releases the memory occupied by the object.
