 Java Basics
Class - Collection of variables and methods
Object - object is the instance of the class
Methods - Task that needs to be executed


Destructor ==> destructor in Java? It is a special method that automatically gets called when an object is no longer used.
When an object completes its life-cycle the garbage collector deletes that object and deallocates or releases the memory occupied by the object.


Access Modifiers
public - accessible to all
default - no need to specify
protected - The protected access modifier is accessible within package and outside the package but through inheritance only.
private - The methods or data members declared as private are accessible only within the class in which they are declared. To make it access we need to
use getters and setters


Encapsulation vs Data Abstraction

Encapsulation is data hiding(information hiding) while Abstraction is detailed hiding(implementation hiding).
While encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon the data, data abstraction deal
with exposing the interface to the user and hiding the details of implementation.
